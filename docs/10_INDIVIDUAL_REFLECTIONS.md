# Individual Reflections

## Member 1: C-jay B. Lavapie
**Role**: Product Lead, Lead Developer, Data & Integration Engineer

Working on the HonestBallot project has been an invaluable learning experience. As the Product Lead and Lead Developer, I was responsible for system architecture, database design, security implementation, and core feature development.

The most challenging aspect was implementing the AI-assisted decision-making system while keeping it transparent and explainable. I overcame this by choosing rule-based AI over machine learning, ensuring every recommendation could be traced back to specific keywords and scoring rules. This taught me the importance of balancing functionality with auditability in electoral systems.

One of my proudest contributions was the comprehensive security layer including bcrypt password hashing, session management with automatic timeouts, and the complete audit logging system. Seeing voters safely cast votes while every action was logged for transparency was incredibly rewarding.

Collaborating with my team members taught me effective delegation and code review practices. We used GitHub for version control and Discord for daily communication, which helped us stay aligned on project goals.

If I could do this project again, I would implement database migrations from the start to make schema changes easier. The emerging technology component reinforced my understanding of how AI can enhance transparency rather than obscure it.

**Role**: UI/UX & Accessibility Designer, QA / Test Coordinator

My journey through the HonestBallot project has significantly enhanced my understanding of frontend development with the Flet framework. Taking on the role of UI/UX Designer and QA Coordinator, I focused primarily on creating intuitive dashboards and ensuring code quality through comprehensive testing.

The dashboard design phase was particularly enlightening. I learned how to create responsive layouts using Flet's ResponsiveRow component and the importance of consistent design language across all user interfaces. Creating the Voter, Politician, COMELEC, and NBI dashboards required understanding each user's unique workflow.

One challenge I faced was implementing the candidate comparison feature with visual feedback. Through research and experimentation, I discovered effective ways to show selection states and guide users through the comparison flow. This experience reinforced the value of user-centered design.

Working with C-jay on backend integration was a pleasure. Our different perspectives and skills complemented each other well, especially when designing the data flow between UI components and the database layer.

The aspect of the project I'm most proud of is the testing suite with 65 passing tests. It required understanding both unit testing principles and integration testing patterns. This project has been more than just an academic exercise—it's been a stepping stone toward becoming a better developer.

**Role**: Documentation & Release Manager

Developing comprehensive documentation for HonestBallot was both challenging and rewarding. As the Documentation Lead, my primary focus was on creating clear, useful documentation that serves both developers and end-users.

Learning to write technical documentation required a different mindset than writing code. The ability to explain complex systems like the AI scoring algorithm and security architecture in accessible language was essential. I particularly enjoyed creating the architecture diagrams and data model documentation.

The biggest challenge I encountered was keeping documentation synchronized with rapidly evolving code. After trying several approaches, I finally solved it by establishing documentation review checkpoints aligned with our development sprints. This taught me the value of treating documentation as a first-class deliverable.

Collaborating with the development team required clear communication about implementation details. We established a process where developers would brief me on new features before I documented them, ensuring accuracy.

One thing I would do differently is implementing automated documentation generation for the database schema. This would have reduced manual updates when tables changed.

The project has significantly improved my skills in technical writing and release management. I now have a deeper appreciation for how good documentation enables team productivity. Beyond technical skills, I've learned valuable lessons about managing deliverables across a distributed team.
