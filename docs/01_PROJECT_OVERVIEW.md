# HonestBallot - Project Overview & Problem Statement

## Project Title
**HonestBallot** - AI-Enhanced Transparent Voting System

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Electoral transparency and voter trust remain significant challenges in modern democratic systems. Voters often face difficulties in:

1. **Accessing reliable candidate information** - Background data, legal records, and policy positions are scattered across multiple sources
2. **Making informed decisions** - Lack of tools to compare candidates based on personal policy priorities
3. **Trusting the electoral process** - Concerns about vote integrity and audit trails
4. **Understanding complex political platforms** - Policy documents are often inaccessible to average voters

### The Solution
HonestBallot addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Centralized candidate profiles** with verified legal records from NBI integration
- **AI-powered analysis** that matches voter preferences with candidate positions
- **Complete audit logging** for electoral transparency
- **Data visualization** of election statistics and trends
- **Role-based access control** ensuring appropriate data visibility

## Project Vision

To create a transparent, accessible, and intelligent voting platform that empowers Filipino voters to make informed electoral decisions while maintaining complete audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## Target Users

| User Role | Description | Key Capabilities |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Voters** | General public participating in elections | View candidates, cast votes, get AI recommendations |
| **Politicians** | Candidates running for office | Manage profile, view analytics, track support |
| **COMELEC** | Commission on Elections administrators | Manage elections, control voting, view all audit logs |
| **NBI** | National Bureau of Investigation officers | Add/verify legal records for politicians |

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI-Assisted Decision Making** - Rule-based AI analyzes candidate platforms and provides compatibility scores
2. **Legal Transparency** - NBI-verified legal records integrated into candidate profiles
3. **Complete Audit Trail** - Every action logged with role-based visibility
4. **Modern Desktop Experience** - Built with Flet for native cross-platform support
5. **Real-time Analytics** - Live election statistics with data visualization

## Project Scope

This project is developed as a **proof-of-concept** demonstrating how emerging technologies can enhance electoral transparency. It is designed for educational purposes and local demonstration, not for production electoral use.
